# Justus Burger | Web Developer

With more than 8 years experience in the trenches, I have seen many projects through all stages of
development. From small design focused websites, to large enterprise scale applications, I am well
equipped and experienced to handle almost anything you can throw my way.

The first 4 years of my experience was mostly focused on server side development using everything
from PHP, .NET, Python all the way to Ruby on Rails. But I then switched my focus to becoming a
master in the art of UI development. Since then, I have specialized in AngularJS and most recently
React. 

My weapon of choice is React, Redux, ES6 and Webpack and I believe this will become more and more
prominent in months to come.
